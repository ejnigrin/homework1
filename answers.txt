What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

The difference between merge and rebase lies in how they store the history of commits. When we have two branches and want to integrate the changes from one branch onto another, we can do this by performing a merge. In the commit log, a merge will show individual histories of both branches along with a new merge commit, indicating where the two branches were merged. When we perform a rebase of branch A onto branch B, Git will also integrate the changes of branch A onto branch B. However, when we view the history of the commits, the commit log will show all the commits from branch B followed by the commits from branch A, as if all the work had been done linearly. This can assist in making the history of the project  more readable and understandable.
