What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a location on the internet where one can upload their project for version viewing and/or collaboration. In the context of Git and GitHub, suppose I am working on a project on my local machine. I can make changes and commit those changes to save the history of my work. If I want to collaborate with others, showcase my work, or have a backup of my project on the internet, I can push my project, commit history, and version control to a remote repository (such as GitHub). In Github, one can also make changes to project in the remote repository such as editing, merging, and rebasing, and pull the project to their local machine.
